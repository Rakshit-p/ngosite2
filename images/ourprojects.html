  <h2>Project 1 - Project Felicity(Cheers Foundation)</h2>
  <p>Felicity(n): Intense happiness

The memebers of The Querencia organized a 4 weekend workshop in January and February and worked with the orphanage "Cheers Foundation" where the children interacted with us. Over the course of 4 weeks we conducted an origami session, a games session, a life session where we tried helping them choose what career path to choose, and ended it with a farewell session where we sent them ice creams.

The children were filled with aspirations and told us what they wanted to become as they grew with politicians, doctors and engineers among them. We were beyond excited to have been able to work with such pleasant kids and loved every minute of it.

We can't wait to work with them again sometime in future!</p>

<h2>Project 1 - Project Felicity(Spandana society)</h2>
<p>Felicity(n): Intense happiness

The memebers of The Querencia took part in a 4 weekend workshop in January and February and worked with the orphanage "Spandana Society " where the children interacted with us. Over the course of 4 weeks we conducted an origami session, a games session, a life session where we tried helping them choose what career path to choose, and ended it with a farewell session where we played games like antakshari, dumb charades and atlas.

The children were highly ambitious with most wanting to become doctors. We were beyond excited to have been able to work with such pleasant kids and loved every minute of it.

We can't wait to collaborate with them in our next project!</p>
