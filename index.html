      (n.) A place from which one's strength of character is drawn; A place where one feels at home.


      Jesse Jackson rightly said, "Never look down on anybody unless you're helping him up".
      We, The Querencia represent a group of teenagers striving to improve the lives of unprivileged children. Health and food are what we all require, and aim to provide it to as many children as we can.




      Whilst doing this, we also are here to raise awareness on certain issues we believe are important.

      The projects we'll do in the near future are what we draw the strength of our character from, the place we feel at home, the people we become when we're doing small acts of help which possibly might shape a few futures. That is us, and this is,
      "The Querencia"</p>
